Server:

	When the server starts:
		
		Online users, a global data structure gets initialized as a dictionary.
		Server starts serving on a thread

	When the server gets a request:

		If the server gets a GET on /, a new thread is spawned
		As the new thread is spawned, the server redirects the user to /login and serves the login page
		when the user enters and confirms their user name, online_users get updated with the new entry
		The new entry contains the username and the IP address of the new user
		The server immediately forms a websocket connection with the client
		The server redirects the user to /home and serves the home script
		All the further communication is done through a formatted string over the websocket connection

	When client is on /home:
		
		If user selects Show Online Users button:
			
			A formatted string is sent to the server indicating that the user wants the online_users 
			server reads that message and sends online users list
			if any time a new user is added(or removed), the server sends(refreshes) the list of online users to each user that has online users list opened
			if the user selects a username and selects chat, another formatted message is sent to the server indicating which user wants to chat with which
			This opens a request and which is converted into a formatted string and is sent to the receiver client using online_users
			At the receiver's end the received string is processed and a request and is shown on the received request tab
			if the receiver accepts the request, a formatted string is sent to the server which the server parses to get the 2 users.
			the server then sends a string to both the clients which contains the alternate IP addresses.
			When the user sends a message, that message is parsed and using that IP address, message is sent to the receiver
		
		If user visits the request tab:
			On the received tab, the user will see all the received requests.
			If the user clicks accept on any request, the IP address attached to that request gets attached to a formatted string and is then sent to server and is used by 			the server to send messages to the receiver(Check if the user is online or not)
			A 180 second timer will be running on each request
		
		If the user visits the sent tab:
			A 180s timer will be there for each request
			all the sent requests will be visible here
			on each request, a cancel button will be there
			clicking the cancel button will send a formatted string to the server and the formatted string will have all the info of that particular request
			
	When client is on /chat:
		on the right hand side of the screen, there will be the request tab(collapsed)
		The user can type anything in the message bar and send it using the send button next to the bar.
		If any user sends a message, the message gets put in a JSON and has the adequate metadata to let server to send the receiver the message
		If the client chooses to leave the chat, they can click the leave button and it sends thee server a formatted string that ends the session.
